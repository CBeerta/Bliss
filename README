NAME:
	rssReader

Version: 0.9.0

AUTHORS:
	Claus Beerta <claus@beerta.de>


DESCRIPTION:

	rssReader is a simple application which can be used to gather a set of RSS/RDF feeds, 
	and compile them into one single Page ordered by Date.
	I build it because i liked PlanetGnome (http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/planetgnome/) alot, but
	didn't like the Python Spycyroll (http://spycyroll.sourceforge.net/).


REQUIREMENTS:

	Smarty (It is included under 'libs/' you don't need to bring your own version)
	XML_RSS from Pear (It is now included also, you don't need the pear version anymore)
	PHP 4.0.6 or later
	
	
INSTALLATION:
	
	Untar the archive into your webservers directory. 
	Open the 'config.inc.php' in you favorite editor and follow the instructions in that file.
	You need to set '$datadir' and '$smartyCompileDir' and, of course, the '$sources'.
	Then open 'rssFetch.php' with either the CLI version of php (php -q rssFetch.php), or call 
	fhe file in your webbrowser.
	After you've called rssFetch.php once, you can now open rssReader.php in your webbrowser and
	see the results.
	For automatic updates of the feed sources, setup a cron-job to either call 'rssFetch.php' with
	the CLI version of PHP, or simply via wget to your webserver.
	
CUSTOMIZATION:
	
	If you are familiar with Smarty (http://smarty.php.net) you can open 'templates/index.tpl.html' and
	edit it to your likings. You should leave the two '{sections}' intact though, otherwise you won't see
	anything.
	
TODO:
	
	Tell me!


BUGS:
	
	Probably alot. This is the first version. Tested with a couple of feeds, but there are probably alot
	that don't work correct. Patches welcome.
